# Fine-Tuning of CNN models

> In order to transfer learning of pretrained models to solve specific problems, this project shows how to apply a famous machine learning technique called **fine-tuning**.

## Requirements

- Conda 34.5.0
  - Python 3.11
  - Keras & Tensorflow
  - Pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - and more dependencies. See the [configuration file here](./environment.yml)
